# Synthesizer project

This code is used to run a small handheld synthesizer I built using an Arduino as a controller.

For this project, I generated the synth sounds in Sonic-Pi using the script sonic-pi.rb. 
Because the physical controller outputs MIDI notes, it can be used in most standard DAWs or similar programs.
